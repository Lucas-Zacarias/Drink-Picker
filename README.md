# Drink-Picker
It is an app created especially for the ***John Foos Argentina*** brand event, which took place on August 9, 2022. The app gave event attendees the chance to vote on their favorite drink after a tasting

## Used technology
- Jetpack Compose
- Dagger-Hilt
- Room
- SSJetPackComposeProgressButton (library used to customize the voting button)
- Coroutines

This app is designed to adapt to the screen size of both smartphones and tablets, and screen orientation

The use of Room is reflected in a different branch, which is called [custom-version](https://github.com/Lucas-Zacarias/Drink-Picker/tree/custom-version), where I included a vote counter and Roboto font
